# javascript.info
A repo with everything I've learned about JavaScript from <a href="https://javascript.info/">javascript.info</a>

Not everything is included from the course, like the introduction; only the sections that I deemed relevant </br>
for someone using ES6. 

I've followed most of the chapters and sections, copying information in my own words for the most part and often </br>
reusing code. All Task.js files have the corresponding section tasks' solutions written solely by me and amended </br>
to include better solutions if offered by javascript.info. It has been a wonderful resource to learn several core </br>
concepts that JavaScript has to offer, ranging from simple primitive datatypes like string, number, boolean, etc. </br>
to more advanced concepts like recursion, unit testing, promisification, modules, and more. I appreciate how much </br>
work went into the documentation and found the content easy to absorb (for the most part) due to the attention to </br>
detail and concise examples given.

My intention was not to copy the course documentation word-for-word, but to digest the information and reiterate it </br>
in my own words to demonstrate my understanding of the topics. This extends to the exercises (tasks) in which I </br>
solved each and every task on my own before revealing the solution.

This has all been an exercise to familiarize myself with the language on a deeper level, and I've spent multiple hours </br>
across multiple nights working through as many of the relevant sections as possible. While it is difficult to tell how </br>
many hours I've spent on this project, I have consistently spent between 2-4 hours per night, when possible, working </br>
through each section over the course of several weeks. Currently, I plan on only completing Part I before moving on to React.
