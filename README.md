# javascript.info
A repo with everything I've learned about JavaScript from <a href="https://javascript.info/">javascript.info</a>

Not everything is included from the course, like the introduction; only the sections that I deemed relevant </br>
for someone using ES6. 

I've followed most of the chapters and sections, copying information in my own words for the most part and often reusing code. 
All Task.js files have the corresponding section tasks' solutions written solely by me and amended to include better solutions </br>
if offered by javascript.info. It has been a wonderful resource to learn several core concepts that JavaScript has </br>
to offer, ranging from simple primitive datatypes like string, number, boolean, etc. to more advanced concepts like </br>
recursion, unit testing, promisification, modules, and more. I appreciate how much work went into the documentation </br>
and found the content easy to absorb (for the most part) due to the attention to detail and concise examples given.

My intention was not to copy the course documentation word-for-word, but to digest the information and reiterate it in my </br>
own words to demonstrate my understanding of the topics. This extends to the exercises (tasks) in which I solved each and </br>
every task on my own before revealing the solution.

This has all been an exercise to familiarize myself with the language on a deeper level, and I've spent </br>
multiple hours across multiple nights working through as many of the relevant sections as possible. While </br>
it is difficult to tell how many hours I've spent on this project, at the time of writing (5/26/2025) I have </br>
made it through the Advanced Functions - Recursion and Stack section after starting from the very beginning of the </br>
course on 5/11/2025. That would put me at about 55-60% through Part I, and 30-35% of the overall course if I plan on </br>
completing Part II as well. Currently I plan on only completing Part I before moving on to React, and so I expect </br>
to be finished with javascript.info around 6/8/2025.
