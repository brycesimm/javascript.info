# javascript.info
A repo with everything I've learned about JavaScript from <a href="https://javascript.info/">javascript.info</a>

Not everything is included from the course, like the introduction; only the </br>
sections that I deemed relevant for someone using ES6. 

I've followed, through, copying information in my own words for the most part and </br>
often reusing code. All Task.js files have the corresponding section tasks' solutions </br>
written solely by me and amended to include better solutions if offered by javascript.info.

My intention was not to copy the course documentation word-for-word, but to digest the information </br>
and reiterate it in my own words to demonstrate my understanding of the topics. This extends to </br>
the exercises (tasks) in which I solved each and every task on my own before revealing the solution.
